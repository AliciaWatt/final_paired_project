You have been contracted by the State of Colorado to create a software system that can track its yearly budgets. Specifically, they would like you to implement the following functionality:

1. Each budget has a year, as well as a way to read that data
2. A budget can list all of its departments
3. A budget can list all departments with expenses less than $500
4. A budget can list all employees' salaries

Build upon your code from the first two iterations to complete this task.
